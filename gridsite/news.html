        <h3>Here is an interview from Humans of Coffee that interviewed me about 6 months after starting Caballo Rojo 
            in Durham.</h3>

        <p>>Who is Gabriela Kavanaugh?</p>

            <p>I am a weird person, and I will proudly say that God made me this way, ha.
            
            I have a very unique sense of humor that often leaves people wondering “where in the world that came from.” I am a high feeler, so I tend to empathize with others very easily.
            
            I think it’s important to remember what really matters about this life, everything is fleeting except our souls. I want my life to impact others hearts and hence relationships are of utmost importance to me.
            
            That being said, my faith in Jesus Christ gives me the ability to love others because Jesus chose to die for me when
             I was at my worst state. Everyone is in need of love and having experienced this I want to share it with others.</p>>
            
           <p> What is your favorite childhood memory?</p>>
            
           <p> Many of my childhood memories are coffee related, because my grandfather was a Venezuelan coffee roaster. 
               My fondest memory that involved coffee has a lot to do with why I am a coffee professional today. 
               We had these brown ceramic espresso cups that my mom got from her mom and in them my mom would make
                “café con leche,” a dollop of foamy milk with some coffee. This happened every saturday morning starting as 
                early as my memories go back.</p>>
            
            <p>if you could have a do-over in life, what would you do differently?</p>>
            
            <p>Honestly nothing. I truly believe that the decisions we make, good or bad, shape who we are. I hope to
                 never give regret the power to drive me from taking risks.</p>>
            
            <p>What do you feel most proud of?</p>>
            
            <p>I am at the point in my coffee career where I have bumped shoulders with amazing coffee professionals.
                 Honestly this has been super intimidating and I have struggled with comparing my coffee business and
                  experiences with theirs. With time I have come to see that we all are starting with no experience and 
                  we all have opportunities to grow. The specialty coffee world is intimidating to outsiders and even those
                   who are a part of it and I feel most proud of growing into my own in the midst of all of this. I am starting
                    to realize that my measure of success has to be based on different terms. Success means that today I did my
                     best to bring life to people.</p>>
            
          
            
            <p>What is your passion project?</p>>
            
            <p>Currently I am growing a coffee roasting company, Caballo Rojo Coffee. This started when I was questioning what 
                was the intersection between my passions, skills and life experiences. I quickly started connecting the dots 
                and saw that roasting coffee could be it. My grandfather was a major player in the coffee industry in Venezuela
                 in the 60s-70s, he was the president of the coffee association and had a huge roastery. Though he died at a young
                  age my mom continued to teach us about the coffee industry. We traveled a lot as kids and on many trips to 
                  Latin America we met coffee farmers and visited local roasteries. To this day I still know several coffee farmers
                   that I hope to partner with in the near future. My love for culture and desire to see it spread through coffee seemed 
                   like the perfect start. I started roasting and buying coffee from importing companies like, Caravela and Ally Coffee, 
                   who work directly with farmers to get their beans. I realized that I could make a difference in my local community by 
                   connecting it with international communities.</p>>
            
            
            
            <p>What is your favorite kind of coffee?</p>
            
            <p>I tend to gravitate toward Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and I love a nice pour over from a Kalita wave or a good shot 
                of espresso.</p>
