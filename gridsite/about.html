                    <p>Gabriela Kavanaugh is the owner and roaster of Caballo Rojo Coffee. Blazing her own trail
                        as a new coffee roaster, Gabi is excited about all this coffee adventure will teach her.
                        Throughout this process thus far there have been new relationships made with farmers, importers,
                        and customers growing Gabi's definition of community. Her biggest supporter and the one
                        encouraging
                        to dream big is her loving and fun husband Dustin</p>

                    <img src="graphics/dad.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:80%" alt="History">
                    <p>Caballo Rojo is deeply rooted in Gabi's Latin American heritage. In Venezuela in the late 60's
                        Gabi's
                        grandfather started his own roasting company which grew into a coffee empire. The name of his
                        roastery
                        was Caballo Rojo and he used this company to provide for his six children while investing in his
                        community.
                        He created jobs, connected with farmers and implemented the values of giving back and working
                        with excellence.
                        However with his unexpected death at a young age the coffee company was soon taken over by
                        investors and things
                        changed for the family. The effects of his of company didn't stop there, but lead to a passion
                        that would continue
                        for generations.</p>

                    <p>Caballo Rojo Coffee is dedicated to making a difference in this world. Our plan is to continue to
                        build direct trade
                        relationships, become an integral part of our community and give an ever increasing percentage
                        of our income to the
                        International Justice Mission. </p>
                    <p>Every month Gabi gives free coffee to her local church for their volunteers. Her church is an
                        integral part
                        in the Durham Community and many of it’s members are involved in foster care, homeless ministry
                        and prison
                        ministry, thus a portion of our proceeds is given monthly to support the continued service of
                        our Durham
                        Family.</p>
