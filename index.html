   <p> A shiny stainless steel sculpture created by Jeff Koons in 1986, 
       inspired by a child’s inflatable toy, sold at Christie’s on Wednesday night 
       for $91.1 million with fees, breaking the record at auction for a work by a
        living artist, set just last November by David Hockney.      </p>

   <p> Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven 
       Mnuchin, made the winning bid for Mr. Koons’s 1986 “Rabbit” from an aisle seat
        near the front of the salesroom. He was seated near Peter Brant, the collector 
        and private museum-owner, and Jeffrey Deitch, the dealer.        </p>
